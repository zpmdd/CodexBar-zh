# Codex provider

Codex has four usage data paths (OAuth API, web dashboard, CLI RPC, CLI PTY) plus a local cost-usage scanner.
The OAuth API is the default app source when credentials are available; web access is optional for dashboard extras.

## Data sources + fallback order

### App default selection (debug menu disabled)
1) OAuth API (auth.json credentials).
2) CLI RPC, with CLI PTY fallback when needed.
3) If OpenAI cookies are enabled (Automatic or Manual), dashboard extras load in parallel and the source label becomes
   `primary + openai-web`.

Usage source picker:
- Preferences → Providers → Codex → Usage source (Auto/OAuth/CLI).

### CLI default selection (`--source auto`)
1) OpenAI web dashboard (when available).
2) Codex CLI RPC, with CLI PTY fallback when needed.

### OAuth API (preferred for the app)
- Reads OAuth tokens from `~/.codex/auth.json` (or `$CODEX_HOME/auth.json`).
- Refreshes access tokens when `last_refresh` is older than 8 days.
- Calls `GET https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/wham/usage` (default) with `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

### OpenAI web dashboard (optional, off by default)
- Enable it in Preferences -> Providers -> Codex -> OpenAI web extras.
- It exists for dashboard-only extras such as code review remaining, usage breakdown, and credits history.
- It is intentionally opt-in because it loads `chatgpt.com` in a hidden WebView and can materially increase battery or network usage.
- OpenAI web battery saver is a separate toggle. When enabled, routine background/settings-driven refreshes are reduced, but explicit manual refreshes still run.
- OpenAI web battery saver currently defaults to off.
- Preferences → Providers → Codex → OpenAI cookies (Automatic or Manual).
- URL: `https://chatgpt.com/codex/settings/usage`.
- Uses an off-screen `WKWebView` with a per-account `WKWebsiteDataStore`.
  - Store key: deterministic UUID from the normalized email.
- WebKit store can hold multiple accounts concurrently.
- WebView navigation and same-origin dashboard API preflights use a Chrome-like browser User-Agent. This keeps
  Cloudflare/session cookies imported from Chrome aligned with the request fingerprint.
- Cookie import (Automatic mode, when WebKit store has no matching session or login required):
  1) Chrome/Chromium profiles: `~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/*/Cookies`
  2) Safari: `~/Library/Cookies/Cookies.binarycookies`
  3) Firefox: `~/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/*/cookies.sqlite`
  4) Other Chromium variants from the shared browser import order.
  - Domains loaded: `chatgpt.com`, `openai.com`.
  - No cookie-name filter; we import all matching domain cookies.
- Cached cookies: Keychain cache `com.steipete.codexbar.cache` (account `cookie.codex`, source + timestamp).
  Reused before re-importing from browsers.
- Manual cookie header:
  - Paste the `Cookie:` header from a `chatgpt.com` request in Preferences → Providers → Codex.
  - Used when OpenAI cookies are set to Manual.
- Account match:
  - Signed-in email extracted from `client-bootstrap` JSON in HTML (or `__NEXT_DATA__`).
  - If Codex email is known and does not match, the web path is rejected.
- Web scrape payload (via `OpenAIDashboardScrapeScript` + `OpenAIDashboardParser`):
  - Rate limits (5h + weekly) parsed from body text.
  - Credits remaining parsed from body text.
  - Code review remaining (%).
  - Usage breakdown chart (Recharts bar data + legend colors).
  - Credits usage history table rows.
  - Credits purchase URL (best-effort).
- Errors surfaced:
  - Login required or Cloudflare interstitial.

### OpenAI web troubleshooting

- Missing session/weekly hover chart and the credits card message `OpenAI web dashboard returned an empty page` share the same
  root path: dashboard extras are unavailable, so `usageBreakdown` is empty and the menu has no hosted chart submenu.
- If Chrome can open `https://chatgpt.com/codex/settings/usage`, make sure macOS has allowed CodexBar access to
  `Chrome Safe Storage`; automatic import now tries Chrome before Safari.
- Safari may prove account identity through `/backend-api/me` but still fail the hidden WebView dashboard scrape on some
  machines. Keep Safari as a fallback, but prefer Chrome when debugging Codex OpenAI web extras.
- A repeated Keychain prompt usually means browser cookie import is being retried after a failed dashboard scrape. Once a
  Chrome cookie is imported and cached successfully, the Keychain cache should reduce repeated prompts.
- `Codex login failed: missing field command in mcp_servers.figma` is not a dashboard problem. It comes from an invalid
  local Codex CLI config block in `~/.codex/config.toml`; remove or correct the URL-only `[mcp_servers.figma]` block.
- `unknown variant xhigh` from `codex login status` means the installed Codex CLI does not support that reasoning value.
  Use `high` in `~/.codex/config.toml` for CLI compatibility.

### Codex CLI RPC (default CLI fallback)
- Launches local RPC server: `codex -s read-only -a untrusted app-server`.
- JSON-RPC over stdin/stdout:
  - `initialize` (client name/version)
  - `account/read`
  - `account/rateLimits/read`
- Provides:
  - Usage windows (primary + secondary) with reset timestamps.
  - Credits snapshot (balance, hasCredits, unlimited).
  - Account identity (email + plan type) when available.

### Codex CLI PTY fallback (`/status`)
- Runs `codex` in a PTY via `TTYCommandRunner`.
- Default behavior: exit after each probe; Debug → "Keep CLI sessions alive" keeps it running between probes.
- Sends `/status`, parses the rendered screen:
  - `Credits:` line
  - `5h limit` line → percent + reset text
  - `Weekly limit` line → percent + reset text
- Retry once with a larger terminal size on parse failure (short retry window).
- Do not retry on timeout; timed-out probes fail fast and wait for the next refresh cycle.
- Detects update prompts and surfaces a "CLI update needed" error.

## Account identity resolution (for web matching)
1) Latest Codex usage snapshot (from RPC, if available).
2) `~/.codex/auth.json` (JWT claims: email + plan).
3) OpenAI dashboard signed-in email (cached).
4) Last imported browser cookie email (cached).

## Credits
- Web dashboard fills credits only when OAuth/CLI do not provide them.
- CLI RPC: `account/rateLimits/read` → credits balance.
- CLI PTY fallback: parse `Credits:` from `/status`.

## Cost usage (local log scan)
- Source files:
  - Native Codex logs:
    - `~/.codex/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/*.jsonl`
    - `~/.codex/archived_sessions/*.jsonl` (flat; date inferred from filename when present)
    - Or `$CODEX_HOME/sessions/...` + `$CODEX_HOME/archived_sessions/...` if `CODEX_HOME` is set.
  - Supported pi sessions:
    - `~/.pi/agent/sessions/**/*.jsonl`
- Scanner:
  - Native Codex logs parse `event_msg` token_count entries and `turn_context` model markers.
  - pi sessions count assistant-message usage rows and attribute `openai-codex` assistant usage to Codex.
  - pi assistant usage is bucketed by assistant-turn timestamp, so mixed-model pi sessions can contribute to multiple
    days/models correctly.
- Cache:
  - Native + merged provider cache: `~/Library/Caches/CodexBar/cost-usage/codex-v2.json`
  - pi session cache: `~/Library/Caches/CodexBar/cost-usage/pi-sessions-v1.json`
- Window: last 30 days (rolling), with a 60s minimum refresh interval.
